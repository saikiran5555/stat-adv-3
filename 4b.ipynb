    "To create a hypothesis regarding whether the average weight of male college students is greater than that of female college students, you need to formulate both a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. These hypotheses are the basis for statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null hypothesis typically represents a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'. In this context, the null hypothesis would state that there is no difference in average weight between male and female college students, or that the average weight of male students is less than or equal to that of female students. Formally, it can be expressed as:\n",
