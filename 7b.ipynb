    "Hypothesis testing is a systematic method used in statistical analysis to make inferences about populations based on sample data. The process involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulating Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (\n",
    "�\n",
    "0\n",
    "H \n",
    "0\n",
    "​\n",
    " ): This is a statement of no effect, no difference, or status quo. It is what you seek to test against.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (\n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    "H \n",
    "A\n",
    "​\n",
    "  or \n",
    "�\n",
    "1\n",
    "H \n",
    "1\n",
    "​\n",
    " ): This is what you suspect might be true instead of the null hypothesis. It represents the effect, difference, or change.\n",
    "Choosing the Right Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select an appropriate statistical test based on the nature of your data and the hypothesis. This depends on factors like the type of data, the number of samples, whether the samples are independent or paired, and the distribution of the data (normal or non-normal).\n",
    "Setting the Significance Level (\n",
    "�\n",
    "α):\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Commonly, a level of 0.05 (5%) is chosen.\n",
    "Collecting Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather the sample data necessary to perform the test. The data should be relevant and collected in a manner that avoids biases.\n",
    "Calculating the Test Statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the chosen test, calculate the test statistic (e.g., t-statistic, z-statistic, F-statistic) from your data. This involves using specific formulas that correspond to the test.\n",
    "Determining the P-Value or Critical Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "Alternatively, one can use a critical value approach, where the test statistic is compared to a critical value from a statistical distribution (e.g., t-distribution, normal distribution).\n",
    "Drawing a Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value \n",
    "≤\n",
    "�\n",
    "≤α: Reject the null hypothesis. There's enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "If p-value \n",
    ">\n",
    "�\n",
    ">α: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There's not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "In the critical value approach, if the test statistic exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, it is not rejected.\n",
    "Reporting the Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly present the findings, including the test statistic, p-value or critical value, and the conclusion about the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpret the results in the context of the research question, considering any limitations or assumptions of the test."
